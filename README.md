This Gradio-based application allows users to upload a CSV file, ask questions about its contents, and generate visualizations. The app leverages the Ollama framework for LLM-based question answering and includes robust CSV parsing and graph plotting capabilities.

üöÄFeatures:

1. CSV File Upload: Easily upload CSV files with automatic error handling.
2. Question Answering System: Ask both numerical and textual queries about the CSV data.
3. Graph Plotting: Generate Line, Bar, and Scatter plots directly within the Gradio interface.
4. LLM Integration: Uses Ollama with the LLaMA 3 model for intelligent query processing.
5. User-Friendly Interface: Simple yet powerful interface built with Gradio.
